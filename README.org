Sandbox for testing out stuff for Luis/Jorge projects

The idea is to give me freedom to experiment with things without messing up the Dropbox folders. 

* Work flow
+ Make changes on =devel= branch of =bowshock-shape=
+ Do tests on the data here, directly using programs in =bowshock-shape/read-shapes-LL=
+ When it is ready to share:
  1. merge to =master=
  2. run =make= to copy to Dropbox
